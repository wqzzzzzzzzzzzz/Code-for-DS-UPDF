Title of the paper: "Data-Selective Uniform Probability Density Function for Adaptive Filtering".

Here is the code for the experiments related to DS-UPDF. The numerical simulation code from the paper includes simulations in prior-selection (LMS,RLS) scenarios and post-selection (DS-ULMS, DS-URLS, DS-ULMF, DS-UGMCC) scenarios. These are respectively named LMS_prior_selection, RLS_prior_selection, DS_ULMS, DS_URLS, DS-ULMF, DS-UGMCC. All parameter settings are explained in the manuscript. 
Thank you for your attention!
